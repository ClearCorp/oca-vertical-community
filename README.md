Odoo Modules allowing to transform it into a powerful tool for managing communities

We plan to place this project under the OCA umbrella https://github.com/OCA once it meets the OCA quality guidelines. 
For this we still have to add correct documentation, make test scripts and format the code in PEP-8. We hope that this quality will be meet at September 2014.

Translation still happen on launchpad : https://translations.launchpad.net/openerp-communitytools
