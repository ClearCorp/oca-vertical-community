Contributions are welcome. Please read the guidelines of the OCA : http://odoo-community.org/page/website.how-to

Temporary process :
Currently we have a dozen of modules to include in the OCA repo which are not reviewed yet. Reviewing it will take time and we can't stop develop on them during that time.
Theses modules are under the __unreviewed__ directory and must not be already considered OCA quality.

The modules will be reviewed one by one, when a module is ready to be reviewed it will be pushed out of __unreviewed__ directory through a merge request.
Every commit concerning a module already reviewed shall respect the OCA guidelines.
Every commit which concern only modules in __unreviewed__ directory shall be marked with [UNREVIEWED] tag and is allowed to be directly merge without respecting the two reviewers rule.

This is only a temporary process until all modules are reviewed. No modules other than the current ones shall be accepted inside __unreviewed__ directory.
