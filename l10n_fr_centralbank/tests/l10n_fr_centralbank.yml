  In order to test account transaction I create a new transaction
-
  !context
    uid: 'base.user_demo'

  !record {model: account.centralbank.transaction, id: transaction_test_1}:
    sender_id: base.partner_demo

    description: 'Test transaction between users'
    currency_ids:
      - model: "account.centralbank.transaction"
        field: "currency_ids"
        price_unit: 50
        currency_id: base.EUR
